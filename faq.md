# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This is a list of FAQs that is divided into two areas - applying for the internship program and onboarding (joining) onto the internship program.

# Applying for the internship program

Here are some Frequently Asked Questions that we hear from students.

## How do I know if I am eligible?

For the enginering students, please contact engit-placements [at] unimelb [dot] edu [dot] au. For the data science and maths students, please contact science-industry-internships[at] unimelb [dot] edu [dot] au.

## How flexible are the starting dates? 

We are flexible. We aim to keep the same starting dates for everyone to make it easier to put people into the WEHI system, but the actual date you start can be flexible. You could start a week or two later if you need to. We are also flexible if you need to take time off during the internship as well.

## Where are the details I need to fill in my form?

You can find the information here:
- These internships are 100% remote.
- The [intake dates and hours per week are here](intake_dates).
-  Supervisor/ Industry Contact details such as the title of the supervisor and phone number should be in the emails sent by your supervisor.
-  An official letter on company letterhead/ An email from the host supervisor with their contact details visible should be the email offer you received from your supervisor.

## I know that the internships are usually 100% offsite, but what if I want to go into the office sometimes?

We are open to having some opportunities to go to the office, especially if we can catchup with the other students. It would not be that regular though, but this can be discussed with other students. We also have a [monthly onsite lunch with other Research Software Engineers around Parkville]([url](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/o/the-rse-association-of-australia-and-new-zealand-65201929823)).

## How do I know you won't get disengaged with the students?

We are committed to providing guidance, support, and mentorship throughout their internship experience. We recognize the importance of maintaining open lines of communication and being accessible to address their needs.

To ensure ongoing engagement, we have weekly check-ins with the student interns to discuss their progress, challenges, and goals.

We aim to get them to understand the conceptual parts on these weekly check-ins, so that they can work with the technical side of things at their own pace.

There is also a Virtual Computing Drop-in as well as a Thursday meeting to talk more generally about careers and other skills.

## What is the difference between data engineering, data analysis, and software engineering?

Data engineering is focused on streamlining and cleaning data systematically. Data analysis is focused on cleaning data and analysing it using statistical or machine learning algorithms. Software engineering is focused on systematising analysis or tools that help us make decisions.

# Onboarding onto the internship program (Workday)


## The Workday email says "On your first day, please arrive at 9.00am unless your manager has advised an alternative time and ask for your manager upon arrival at reception." - is this accurate?

No, it is not accurate. This is a 100% remote internship and that part of the Workday email can be safely ignored. On your first day, you will be scheduled some virtual drop-in sessions so you can meet the supervisor and other interns. 

## I setup my Workday (HR system) through an initial email but now that password doesn't work or I cannot login to my WEHI email

The links you might have previously used to access Workday before your official start date will no longer allow access.  Email hr [at] wehi [dot] edu [dot] au as this is the contact provided if you encounter any issue in regard to Workday. They will provided you with the new credentials to set up your WEHI email. You may need to go into Incognito mode to get it to work.

## What courses in Workday do I need to complete?

These are the key courses you need to do:
- Law at Work - Privacy for the Private Sector
- Law at Work - Sexual Harassment Prevention
- Law at Work - Workplace Bullying
- Law at Work - Anti-discrimination and Equal Opportunity
- Acceptable Workplace Behaviour at WEHI

These are the courses you could do if interested:
- Understanding Risk Management
- WEHI Child Safe Training
- Workday basics

These are the ones you can ignore as you are 100% remote:
- Safety Orientation Program - Laboratory
- Safety Orientation Program - General


# Onboarding onto the internship program (Non-Workday)

## Given that the internship is remote, am I allowed to complete the internship while on travel?

Yes, that is correct.

## The description stated that so many hrs per week is expected, but at roughly which times and for how long?

As it is remote, we are very flexible but there are times when we do get together, such as the weekly project meeting. This is explained in [the Student Internship Handbook](https://figshare.com/articles/presentation/Research_Computing_Platform_Student_Internship_Handbook/21259467).

## My project is complex and ambiguous - what can I do to deal with this?

All of the projects are complex and ambiguous. 

This is [an explanation on how to deal with a complex and ambiguous project](complex-projects).

## What is the overall structure of the internship going to look like?

To understand how the overall process of the project will be

1. Improve understanding at high level from wiki to help student interns be independent
2. Improve understanding at technical level from Sharepoint / Onboarding page on wiki
3. Write up a presentation to say what you think you should do on the project. This helps student interns become independent
4. Start improving on the project by working independently
5. Do a final presentation to explain how you improved the project, along with updated documentation on wiki/Sharepoint


## You ask us to be as independent as possible. How can we do that?

Rules of thumb for being independent:
- If you don't know why at a high level, you won't be independent. Always take the time to understand high level, so that you can anticipate the client
- The idea is that you can guess what the client (me) is going to say before I say it
- And the idea is to ask a question, knowing what the client is going to say, this allows you to test your understanding of the problem
- If you ask a question, and they say something different, then you need to ask why



## What should I put in the public wiki?

The public wiki is to share information with future students the things you needed to understand at a high level to be able to start working on the technical side of the project.

General knowledge to put into the wiki would include (among others):
- A diagram showing how the high-level parts of the system interact
- A diagram of how the biology works at a simple level that you need for the project
- A diagram to show how the overall steps of the workflow and a simple explanation of why each step is done

NOTE: Please ensure that anything you put in the public domain is not private. The rule of thumb is that if you found the material on the public internet, you can treat it as public. If you found the material within WEHI or from a WEHI source, you should ask if you can make it public. If you are not sure, please ask your supervisor.

## What should I put in my technical diary?

Within your project channel in Sharepoint, you should have a Technical notes folder for your intake eg. Semester 2 2023 Technical notes. This is to help future students understand what you did in detail to get your results.

Technical knowledge to put into your technical diary in Sharepoint (among others) would include:
- commandline commands you used to setup your sofwtware system eg. pip install pandas
- technical errors you encountered and how you fixed them, or what was the process you found to fix them
- general technical notes that took you some time to figure out that might help a future student
- any technical help you received from other students, mentors, or supervisors 


## How should I ask for help to solve a problem?

There is a way to escalate how to ask for help. This shows you how you can escalate a problem in order from start to finish:

1. Try to solve it yourself via documentation provided in the wiki and in Sharepoint
2. Try to solive it yourself via an internet search
3. Try to solve it using ChatGPT, provided that the information you provide ChatGPT is not private to WEHI
4. Ask your fellow students
5. Ask your supervisor, and cc in your fellow students

Please also make sure you [explain the problem in detail, with screenshots and any error messages](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-times-youll-need-to-ask-your-tech-team-for-help-and-how-to-do-it-right). These should be saved into your technical diary that should be stored in Sharepoint.

## What are the key things to do before the weekly meetings? 

Key things to do before for the regular weekly meeting (yes even the first one that is usually in week 2):
1. Please meet as a team before the meeting without your supervisors to ensure you as a team of students are all on the same page
2. Please send a weekly email update 24 hours before the meeting with the subject '[Project name] week [x] update' eg. 'Clinical Dashboards week 3 update'. The email should have:
    1. what each student has done,
    2. write down any questions you have for the meeting to use as an agenda,
    3. provide a link to the wiki, and
    4. provide a link to the technical notes in WEHI-wide student intern group in Sharepoint / Files in Teams
    5. remember to ask to record the meeting to more easily keep notes if needed
