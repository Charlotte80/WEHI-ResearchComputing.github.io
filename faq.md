# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This is a list of FAQs that is divided into two areas - applying for the internship program and onboarding (joining) onto the internship program.

# Applying for the internship program

Here are some Frequently Asked Questions that we hear from students.

## How do I know if I am eligible?

For the enginering students, please contact engit-placements [at] unimelb [dot] edu [dot] au. For the data science and maths students, please contact science-industry-internships[at] unimelb [dot] edu [dot] au.

## How flexible are the starting dates? 

We are flexible. We aim to keep the same starting dates for everyone to make it easier to put people into the WEHI system, but the actual date you start can be flexible. You could start a week or two later if you need to. We are also flexible if you need to take time off during the internship as well.

## Where are the details I need to fill in my form?

You can find the information here:
- These internships are 100% remote.
- The [intake dates and hours per week are here](intake_dates).
-  Supervisor/ Industry Contact details such as the title of the supervisor and phone number should be in the emails sent by your supervisor.
-  An official letter on company letterhead/ An email from the host supervisor with their contact details visible should be the email offer you received from your supervisor.

## I know that the internships are usually 100% offsite, but what if I want to go into the office sometimes?

We are open to having some opportunities to go to the office, especially if we can catchup with the other students. It would not be that regular though, but this can be discussed with other students. We also have a [monthly onsite lunch with other Research Software Engineers around Parkville]([url](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/o/the-rse-association-of-australia-and-new-zealand-65201929823)).

## How do I know you won't get disengaged with the students?

We are committed to providing guidance, support, and mentorship throughout their internship experience. We recognize the importance of maintaining open lines of communication and being accessible to address their needs.

To ensure ongoing engagement, we have weekly check-ins with the student interns to discuss their progress, challenges, and goals.

We aim to get them to understand the conceptual parts on these weekly check-ins, so that they can work with the technical side of things at their own pace.

There is also a Virtual Computing Drop-in as well as a Thursday meeting to talk more generally about careers and other skills.

## What is the difference between data engineering, data analysis, and software engineering?

Data engineering is focused on streamlining and cleaning data systematically. Data analysis is focused on cleaning data and analysing it using statistical or machine learning algorithms. Software engineering is focused on systematising analysis or tools that help us make decisions.

# Onboarding onto the internship program

## The Workday email says "On your first day, please arrive at 9.00am unless your manager has advised an alternative time and ask for your manager upon arrival at reception." - is this accurate?

No, it is not accurate. This is a 100% remote internship and that part of the Workday email can be safely ignored. On your first day, you will be scheduled some virtual drop-in sessions so you can meet the supervisor and other interns. 

## Given that the internship is remote, am I allowed to complete the internship while on travel?

Yes, that is correct.

## The description stated that so many hrs per week is expected, but at roughly which times and for how long?

As it is remote, we are very flexible but there are times when we do get together, such as the weekly project meeting. This is explained in [the Student Internship Handbook](https://figshare.com/articles/presentation/Research_Computing_Platform_Student_Internship_Handbook/21259467).

## My project is complex and ambiguous - what can I do to deal with this?

This is [an explanation on how to deal with a complex and ambiguous project](complex-projects).

## I setup my Workday (HR system) through an initial email but now that password doesn't work or I cannot login to my WEHI email

The links you might have previously used to access Workday before your official start date will no longer allow access.  Email hr [at] wehi [dot] edu [dot] au as this is the contact provided if you encounter any issue in regard to Workday. They will provided you with the new credentials to set up your WEHI email. You may need to go into Incognito mode to get it to work.
