# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This is a list of FAQs that is divided into two areas - applying for the internship program and onboarding (joining) onto the internship program.

# Applying for the internship program

Here are some Frequently Asked Questions that we hear from students.

## How do I know if I am eligible?

For the enginering students, please contact engit-placements [at] unimelb [dot] edu [dot] au. For the data science and maths students, please contact science-industry-internships[at] unimelb [dot] edu [dot] au.

## Where are the details I need to fill in my form?

You can find the information here:
- These internships are 100% remote.
- The [intake dates and hours per week are here](intake_dates)
- Title of the supervisor and phone number should be in the emails sent by your supervisor

## I know that the internships are usually 100% offsite, but what if I want to go into the office sometimes?

We are open to having some opportunities to go to the office, especially if we can catchup with the other students. It would not be that regular though, but this can be discussed with other students. We also have a [monthly onsite lunch with other Research Software Engineers around Parkville]([url](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/o/the-rse-association-of-australia-and-new-zealand-65201929823)).

## How do I know you won't get disengaged with the students?

We are committed to providing guidance, support, and mentorship throughout their internship experience. We recognize the importance of maintaining open lines of communication and being accessible to address their needs.

To ensure ongoing engagement, we have weekly check-ins with the student interns to discuss their progress, challenges, and goals.

We aim to get them to understand the conceptual parts on these weekly check-ins, so that they can work with the technical side of things at their own pace.

There is also a Virtual Computing Drop-in as well as a Thursday meeting to talk more generally about careers and other skills.

## What is the difference between data engineering, data analysis, and software engineering?

Data engineering is focused on streamlining and cleaning data systematically. Data analysis is focused on cleaning data and analysing it using statistical or machine learning algorithms. Software engineering is focused on systematising analysis or tools that help us make decisions.

# Onboarding onto the internship program

## I setup my Workday (HR system) through an initial email but now that password doesn't work or I cannot login to my WEHI email

The links you might have previously used to access Workday before your official start date will no longer allow access.  Email hr [at] wehi [dot] edu [dot] au as this is the contact provided if you encounter any issue in regard to Workday. They will provided you with the new credentials to set up your WEHI email.
