# Email - Week 1

Hi All,

Welcome to the RCP Student Internship Program at WEHI. We are excited to have you join our team and provide you with valuable learning opportunities throughout your internship.

This is your email to start week 1 of your internship. You are probably excited and a little bit anxious too. Thatâ€™s OK. Please remember you have other students to connect with and you can always ask your supervisor or me for help.

## WARNING: Please note that you should not turn up to the WEHI building at 9am.

This is a 100% remote internship and that part of the Workday email can be safely ignored. On your first day, you will be scheduled some virtual drop-in sessions so you can meet the supervisor and other interns.

## WARNING: Read the FAQ before setting up Workday

Workday is the Human Resources software tool at WEHI. You will receive an email from Workday and will need to fill in all the forms before you start. You may not receive the Workday email before your start date. This is OK, you will just need to wait and use your student email for the time being. Please also note that there is a Workday FAQ you can find in the FAQ below..

It is usually an issue with students to have issues with Workday.

Please go to [the FAQ and look through all the Workday issues](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#onboarding-onto-the-internship-program-workday) before your start setting up Workday.

## WARNING: Do you have a problem? Please read this first

Many students ask their supervisor questions that could be easily solved within the team. Please read this [to find out when and how to send an email to your supervisor to ask a question](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#how-should-i-ask-for-help-to-solve-a-problem).

## WARNING: Please note that your setup with University of Melbourne may cause confusion in your browser. Please use "Incognito" or "Private" mode when you are troubleshooting.

## Goals for the week

1. Read the onboarding documentation (see below) and ensure you understand the "whys" behind the high-level context and the potential high-level tasks. This is the most important goal for your first week.
2. Setup Workday (if available) based off the information in [the Onboarding onto the Internship program FAQ](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#onboarding-onto-the-internship-program-workday)
3. Reach out to your fellow student interns and supervisors to organise the weekly project meetings for the whole of your internship. Your supervisor can then create a weekly calendar invite on your behalf.
4. Schedule two regular co-working sessions per week with your fellow student interns, without supervisors. These can be used so you can work together. The second co-working session should be co-ordinated with your sister project. A sister project is a project that is working on a similar set of technology to you that you would regularly talk to.
6. Add your WEHI email to the Sharepoint/Teams "WEHI-wide student intern group" by following the ["How do I get access to the WEHI-wide student intern group using my WEHI email address?"](faq#how-do-i-get-access-to-the-wehi-wide-student-intern-group-using-my-wehi-email-address) FAQ
7. Read [the Social Media Policy for student interns](social_media_policy).

You can see the full list in [the key milestones and onboarding emails page](emails-and-key-milestones).
