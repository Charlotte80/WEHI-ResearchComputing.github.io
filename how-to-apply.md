# How to Apply

Due to the volume of students now applying to this internship, to be eligible you must [fill out the RCP Student Internship Enrollment form](https://redcap.wehi.edu.au/surveys/?s=AMYXK9FFHXR9LE9T). 

You can see the [intake dates here](intake_dates).

This is because we now need to streamline our applications and ensure no students are missed in the application process. To do this we need to move from a a manual process to this more automated process. We appreciate that there may be some confusion but any applicants will be redirected to this form as it takes precedence over any other application method. 


## Key Questions you should answer in the cover letter

We suggest that you write a 1 page cover letter introducing yourself. We also have [material on how to write a good cover letter and what to look for when you are writing a resume](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21057535.v2). To help understand your interests and identify potential projects, there are four questions we ask you to answer in your cover letter: 


### 1. Would you prefer to do data engineering, data analytics, full-stack web developer or software engineering?

Data engineering is focused on streamlining and cleaning data systematically.
Data analytics is focused on using cleaned data to visualise and use simple statistical methods (like a z-score).
Full-stack web develepor is about building dynamic websites.
Software engineering is focused on systematising analysis or tools that help us make decisions.

Sometimes our projects can involve all these aspects if you are interested enough!

### 2. Can you tell me a story about learning a new concept quickly?

This might be starting a new job, or a new course and learning the language and the nuances of this new environment.

### 3. Can you tell me a story about learning a new technical skill quickly?

This might be learning a new programming language or new technology in a short amount of time.

### 4. Do you have any questions about the program?

Please let us know if you have any questions about the program that aren't answered in the [RCP Student Internship Program Handbook](/RDM-0220-RCP-Student-Internship-Handbook.pdf), the [FAQ online](faq), or the [RCP Student Internship Onboarding Checklist](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/RDM_0138_RCP_Student_Onboarding_Checklist/23280815).
