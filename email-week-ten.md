# Email - Week 10

Hi All,

This is your email to start week 10 of your internship. Now we are expecting you to focus on writing up your project as a presentation and as a one page summary report.

## Goals for the week

1. Copy the presentation slide mentioned in [the FAQ "What do I need to do for my final presentation and summary report?"](faq#what-do-i-need-to-do-for-my-final-presentation-and-summary-report) to the Sharepoint/Teams and use this as the basis for your final presentation slides. Add this as a link to your wiki's onboarding page.
2. Copy the one page summary report mentioned in [the FAQ "What do I need to do for my final presentation and summary report?"](faq#what-do-i-need-to-do-for-my-final-presentation-and-summary-report) to the Sharepoint/Teams and use this as the basis for your final one page summary report. Add this as a link to your wiki's onboarding page.
3. Share these links with your supervisors in your weekly email.
4. In your meeting this week, ask when will the final presentation be. This is usually in week 12 during semester 1 and 2, and week 14 in the summer intake.
5. The week before the final presentation you will be expected to submit your one page summary report, finalise the onboarding page of the wiki, and give a practice presentation.
