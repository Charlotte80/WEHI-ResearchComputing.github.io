Hi All,

I will be calling you by mobile phone over the next week to get a better understanding of projects that fit your interests and career aspirations. Please let me know if you need to make other arrangements as I can be flexible.  

If I am calling and it is a bad time, donâ€™t answer. I can leave a message and call back later. 

To make things clearer, I have provided the questions I will be asking in the call. Please look through the questions and the website to be prepared for the call. 

1. How do I pronounce your name? I may ask you this question to ensure I do the best I can to pronounce your name.
2. This is a 100% remote internship. This means all meetings are virtual. Are you OK with this?
3. We take Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion seriously. We have a Code of Conduct that you have to abide by that is in the WEHI RCP Student Internship Handbook on page 10. Have you read it and are you willing to abide by it?
4. Are you a talker or are you more of a listener? 
5. Are you more of a facilitator/organiser or a follower? 
6. And are you more of a person who's an intentional thinker where you will need to go away think about it or are you more of a quick brainstormer who likes to share ideas in a meeting?
7. What projects are you interested in and why?
8. I will then show you the projects that are currently still available based on your interests.
9. I will then explain the next steps to you
10. I will ask you if you have any other questions.
