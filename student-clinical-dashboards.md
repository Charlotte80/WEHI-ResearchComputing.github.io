# Clinical Dashboards Student Internship Project

## Introduction

WEHI is currently looking at how to take clinical data from databases and create visualisations and dashboards to help administrators and clinicians explore the data. You can read the [background information and project presentations by former students.](https://figshare.com/projects/Clinical_Dashboards/163360) 

## Duties while on placement 

The Research Data Engineer Intern role will:  
- help create or gather synthetic datasets to allow for open collaboration, 
- identify generic and specific visualisations that would help administrators and clinicians explore the data,
- identify different platforms that could be used to create dashboards and visualisations, and 
- potentially creating exemplar visulisations across more than one platform. 

There is also flexibility with this project to allow the student to inject their own ideas and introduce new features and functionality. 


## Skills and Pre-requisites

- Interest in working with clinically-adjacent data
- Background or willingness to learn visualisation and dashboard tools
- Willingness and ability to learn and understand high-level concepts quickly 
- Ability to work independently and to report to a group and discuss theories and results 
- Good analytical skills 
- Previous experience with git would be useful but not necessary 

## Benefits for students 

Benefits for students whilst undertaking the internship include:
- Working in a clinical-adjacent environment. 
- Practical experience with potential exposure to Python, R, PowerBI and other visualisation software.  
- Gain understanding of how real-world software is assessed, developed and how priorities and requirements are established within a clinical environment.  
- Gain understanding of the importance of maintainable, scalable and extensible code.
