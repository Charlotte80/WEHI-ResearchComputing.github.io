# Research Software Engineer (Data Commons) 

## Introduction 

As part of our ongoing efforts to evaluate and implement innovative data management strategies, we are offering an internship opportunity to work on a proof-of-concept project for a data commons. We are seeking a motivated and detail-oriented intern to join our team and contribute to the development of a proof-of-concept data infrastructure. 

## Duties while on placement 

As a Research Software Engineer Intern, you will play a crucial role in supporting the design and implementation of a proof-of-concept data lakehouse / data commons. This internship will provide you with valuable hands-on experience in trialling, analysing, and improving different platforms. You will assist in building a scalable data management infrastructure and gain exposure to various aspects of data integration, modeling, and governance. 

The Research Software Engineer Intern role will: 

- Assist in testing and implementing data models for the proof-of-concept data commons. 
- Work with the team to implement conceptual and logical data models that align with project objectives. 
- Support the implementation of data ingestion pipelines for the proof-of-concept. 
- Contribute to the development of data governance practices and policies for the proof-of-concept project. 
- Collaborate with the team to plan and build the data management infrastructure for the proof-of-concept data lakehouse / data commons. 
- Assist in documenting the data architecture, design decisions, and implementation processes. Contribute to creating technical documentation and user guides for future reference. 
- Stay updated on emerging data management technologies and industry trends. 
- Explore and experiment with new tools, frameworks, and platforms that can enhance the data lakehouse / data commons implementation. 

 

## Skills and Pre-requisites 

To excel in this internship project, the ideal candidate should have a willingness to research data lakehouses and data commons, an ability to learn quickly, an enthusiasm for research software architecture, and a willingness to share and communicate information. It would be beneficial if the student had an interest in learning Python, System administration, Virtual Machines, and how to improve business workflows.  It would also be of benefit if the student was interested in learning about bioinformatics data formats.
