# Research Software Engineer (Data Commons) 

## Introduction 

As part of our ongoing efforts to evaluate and implement innovative data management strategies, we are offering an internship opportunity to work on a pre-production project for a data commons called REDMANE. We are seeking a motivated and detail-oriented intern to join our team and contribute to the development of a pre-production data infrastructure. 

## Multiple sub-projects within this project

This project is made up of the following sub-projects that an intern can apply for:
- Create synthetic multi-omics data to match synthetic clinical and other metadata
- Extend functionality of the Data Registry application in ReactJS and FASTAPI
- Ingestion of data and metadata into the Data Registry using Python, and authenticating to an API
- Setup standardisation in authentication and security for multiple Data Portals using OIDC, AAF, and KeyCloak
- Setup cBioPortal as a Data Portal on the Nectar Cloud secured with OIDC
- Setup generic secure Shiny/R App as a Data Portal on the Nectar Cloud secured with OIDC
- Setup Omero as a Data Portal on the Nectar Cloud secured with OIDC
- Setup Storage Calculator as a Data Portal on the Nectar Cloud secured with OIDC

## Duties while on placement 

As a Research Software Engineer Intern, you will play a crucial role in supporting the design and implementation of a pre-production Research Data Management ecosystem called REDMANE. This internship will provide you with valuable hands-on experience in trialling, analysing, and improving different platforms. You will assist in building a scalable data management infrastructure and gain exposure to various aspects of data integration, modeling, and governance. 

The Research Software Engineer Intern role will generally: 

- Assist in setup, extending, and testing Data Registry and Data Portals using synthetic data for multiple REDMANE ecosystems. 
- Support the implementation of data ingestion pipelines for Data Registry and Data Portals securely. 
- Contribute to the development of a base set of requirements for Data Portals to be able to be part of the REDMANE ecosystem.
- Setup environment to provide authentication across the Data Registry and Data Portals.
- Setup Data Portals for existing applications such as cBioPortal, Shniy, Omero and custom-made Storage Calculator.
- Assist in documenting the design decisions, and implementation processes.
- Contribute to creating technical documentation and user guides for future reference. 
- Stay updated on emerging data management technologies and industry trends. 
- Explore and experiment with new tools, frameworks, and platforms that can enhance the implementation. 

 

## Skills and Pre-requisites 

To excel in this internship project, the ideal candidate should have a willingness to research data lakehouses and data commons, an ability to learn quickly, an enthusiasm for research software architecture, and a willingness to share and communicate information. It would be beneficial if the student had an interest in learning Python, System administration, Virtual Machines, and how to improve business workflows.  It would also be of benefit if the student was interested in learning about bioinformatics data formats.
