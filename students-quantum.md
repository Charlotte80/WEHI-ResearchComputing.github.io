# Research Software Engineer (Quantum Computing in Bioinformatics) 

## Introduction

Quantum computers are gaining attention from disciplines outside of physics. We are starting to see algorithms being developed that could be used to solve problems in the future. There are many problems that exist in biology and bioinformatics that could be explored with quantum computing. 

Structural biology and drug discovery are two such areas that may be able to use quantum computing in the future as quantum computers mature.  

WEHI is collaborating with the University of Melbourne to create foundational knowledge of quantum computing in biology to ensure that we are prepared for the future. This role is part of that exploration and will help to lay down the foundation of knowledge to allow researchers and research software engineers to accelerate their learning.
