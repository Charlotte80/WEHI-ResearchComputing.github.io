# Full-Stack Developer (Student Organiser) 

## Introduction

The student internship program administered by the Research Computing Platform at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) has been strategically designed to accommodate a substantial number of student participants, typically exceeding 20 students, during each of its three annual intakes. Given the considerable scale of this initiative, a prototype web application has been initially developed to facilitate the program's operations. However, it is recognized that there is room for enhancement and refinement of the current web application.   

It is imperative to consider a comprehensive evaluation of the existing web application to identify areas where improvements and optimizations can be implemented. This critical endeavor aligns with the overarching goal of ensuring that the internship program at WEHI continues to provide an efficient and streamlined experience for both students and program administrators.  

To this end, an in-depth analysis of the web application's functionality, user interface, and overall user experience is warranted. This evaluation should encompass an examination of user feedback, performance metrics, and industry best practices in web application development. Subsequently, a plan for improvement and enhancement can be devised, addressing any identified shortcomings or areas of potential enhancement.  

Moreover, it is essential to foster a collaborative and inclusive approach that engages stakeholders, including students, faculty, and IT professionals, in the process of refining the web application. By harnessing the collective expertise and insights of these individuals, we can ensure that the resultant improvements align with the specific needs and goals of the student internship program at WEHI.  

This project would suit a candidate who was interested in maintaining web application software, wants to gain experience developing a prototype into something more mature and enjoys learning about improving business processes.  

This role is challenging as the person will need to synthesise data, how to understand the way the application is being used, as well as looking at the code and the software best practices to improve the standard of code.  

## Duties while on placement

The Full-Stack Developer Intern role will: 
- Documenting how to setup and run a prototype using synthetic data,
- Identifying problem areas that could be reviewed,  
- Reviewing code and improving speed issues,  
- Reviewing UX and UI,  
- Brainstorming and prototyping solutions of ways to reduce maintenance costs, and  
- Suggest other options and prototype as needed.  

## Skills and Pre-requisites:

- Experience in, or the willingness to learn Python, Flask, or another web framework would be advantageous
- Previous web development experience, or the willing to learn quickly would be advantageous
- Understanding how to quickly learn how the client uses the application and potential process improvement would be advantageous


## Benefits for students 

The benefits for students whilst undertaking the internship include:

- The student will gain practical Software Engineering experience with potential exposure to Flask, Virtual Machines, and how to improve business workflows.   
- The student will gain understanding of how real-world software is assessed, developed and how priorities and requirements are established within a research environment.   
- The student will have an opportunity to self-direct and be proactive in their approach to a new environment.
