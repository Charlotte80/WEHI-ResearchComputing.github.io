# Software Engineer (Conference Organiser)

## Introduction

WEHI will be helping to organise [the third online Research Software Engineer (RSE) Asia Australia Unconference](https://rseaa.github.io/) from the 11th to the 13th of September 2024. This is a joint partnership between the RSE Asia Association and the RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand. The theme for this year is “Sharing tech architectures” and the hashtag will be #RSEAA24. 



We would like to improve the sustainability of the process of organising the conference around some of the key areas such as: 

- Simplifying the way we can send our prospectus to potential sponsors who will provide us with funds to run the conference, 
- Simplifying the way we can send emails to potential keynote speakers, along with followup emails for people who accepted the keynote speaking opportunity, 
- Simplifying the way we can send emails to potential panelists, along with followup emails for people who accepted the opportunity, 
- Simplifying the way we can send emails to potential session chairs, along with followup emails for people who accepted the opportunity, 
- Simplifying the schedule, making it easy for participants to access, and simplifying the way we create Zoom meetings  
- Make it easy to point to other documentation and project management tools, 
- Make it easy to send out emails and social media or to have a schedule to make it easier 

 

The Software Engineer Intern role will:  

- work closely with organisers to identify their needs around maintainability 
- develop the website to improve on functionality in a fast-paced environment 
- review, suggest and apply improvements to the website in an independent manner as possible 

Normally we would like student interns to be able to take things slowly and think at a high level first, but due to the conference being in September, we may need students to take detailed direction more than would be in a normal RSE project. 

Whenever possible, we would like students to become more independent as the internship takes place. In this instance we would not be able to give students as much time to beconme independent due to the need for this software in a short amount of time.  

There is also a fair amount of flexibility with this project to allow the student to inject their own ideas and introduce new features and functionality. 

## Skills and Pre-requisites: 

- Independence of thought 
- Willingness to contribute to understanding the planning of the event 
- Basic knowledge of Python/Javascript/CSS, databases and Linux command-line 
- Ability to learn and understand high-level concepts quickly 
- Ability to work independently and to report to a group and discuss theories and results 
- Good analytical skills 
- Working with git would be an advantage
