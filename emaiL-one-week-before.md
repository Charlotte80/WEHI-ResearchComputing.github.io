# Email - one week before the internship

Hi All,

Welcome to the RCP Student Internship Program at WEHI. We are excited to have you join our team and provide you with valuable learning opportunities throughout your internship.

## WARNING: Please note that you should not turn up to the WEHI building at 9am.

This is a 100% remote internship and that part of the Workday email can be safely ignored. On your first day, you will be scheduled some virtual drop-in sessions so you can meet the supervisor and other interns.

## WARNING: Read the FAQ before setting up Workday

Workday is the Human Resources software tool at WEHI. You will receive an email from Workday and will need to fill in all the forms before you start. You may not receive the Workday email before your start date. This is OK, you will just need to wait and use your student email for the time being. Please also note that there is a Workday FAQ you can find in the FAQ below.

It is usually an issue with students to have issues with Workday.

Please go to [the FAQ and look through all the Workday issues](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#onboarding-onto-the-internship-program-workday) before your start setting up Workday.


## WARNING: Do you have a problem? Please read this first

Many students ask their supervisor questions that could be easily solved within the team. Please read this [to find out when and how to send an email to your supervisor to ask a question](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#how-should-i-ask-for-help-to-solve-a-problem).

## Goals for your first week

1. Read the onboarding documentation
2. Setup Workday (if available)
3. Reach out to your fellow student interns and supervisors to organise the weekly project meetings for the whole of your internship.
4. Schedule two regular co-working sessions per week with your fellow student interns, without supervisors. These can be used so you can work together. The second co-working session should be co-ordinated with your sister project. A sister project is a project that is working on a similar set of technology to you that you would regularly talk to.

You can see the full list in [the key milestones and onboarding emails page](emails-and-key-milestones).


## Onboarding information

Please [read through the onboarding document](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23280815) as this will help you ease your way into WEHI.

I will be adding your student email to the WEHI system so you can gain access to our Sharepoint/Teams. This is temporary as you will be given a WEHI email address via Workday.

Here are a few things you can do before you start:

- You can read about [the top 5 mistakes that students make](top-5-mistakes)
- You can also have a [look at the FAQ](faq)
- You can learn [how to handle a complex and ambiguous project](complex-projects) 
- You can [review your project and look at the available documentation](project-wikis)
- You can also [use this internship as an opportunity to network](faq#i-know-that-the-internships-are-usually-100-offsite-but-what-if-i-want-to-go-into-the-office-sometimes)

If you have any questions or need further clarification regarding the internship program or the onboarding document, please feel free to reach out to me after you have looked through these documents. We are here to assist you and provide any necessary support.

We are looking forward to working with you and wish you a rewarding and successful internship experience.

Regards,

Rowland Mosbergen
