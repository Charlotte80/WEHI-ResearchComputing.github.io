# Email - one week before the internship

Hi All,

Welcome to the RCP Student Internship Program at WEHI. We are excited to have you join our team and provide you with valuable learning opportunities throughout your internship.

## WARNING: Please note that you should not turn up to the WEHI building at 9am.

This is a 100% remote internship and that part of the Workday email can be safely ignored. On your first day, you will be scheduled some virtual drop-in sessions so you can meet the supervisor and other interns.

## WARNING: Read the FAQ before setting up Workday

Workday is the Human Resources software tool at WEHI. You will receive an email from Workday and will need to fill in all the forms before you start. You may not receive the Workday email before your start date. This is OK, you will just need to wait and use your student email for the time being. Please also note that there is a Workday FAQ you can find in the FAQ below.

It is usually an issue with students to have issues with Workday.

## WARNING: Please note that your setup with University of Melbourne may cause confusion in your browser. Please use "Incognito" or "Private" mode when you are troubleshooting.

Please go to [the FAQ and look through all the Workday issues](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#onboarding-onto-the-internship-program-workday) before your start setting up Workday.


## WARNING: Do you have a problem? Please read this first

Many students ask their supervisor questions that could be easily solved within the team. Please read this [to find out when and how to send an email to your supervisor to ask a question](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/faq#how-should-i-ask-for-help-to-solve-a-problem).

## Goals for your first week

1. Read the onboarding documentation (see below) and ensure you understand the "whys" behind the high-level context and the potential high-level tasks. This is the most important goal for your first week.
2. Setup Workday (if available and you are not an Open Source Contributor)
3. Reach out to your fellow student interns and supervisors to organise the weekly project meetings for the whole of your internship.
4. Schedule two regular co-working sessions per week with your fellow student interns, without supervisors. These can be used so you can work together. The second co-working session should be co-ordinated with your sister project. A sister project is a project that is working on a similar set of technology to you that you would regularly talk to.
5. Read [the Social Media Policy for student interns](social_media_policy).

You can see the full list in [the key milestones and onboarding emails page](emails-and-key-milestones).


## Onboarding information

Please [read through the welcome presentation slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGfzSu6evw/npFw4ssvw2n9B2k0HS-wgg/view) as this will help you ease your way into WEHI.

Also make sure you read the Student Projects Outline document (link is in the welcome presentation slides) so you can understand the high-level context and potential high-level tasks.

Here are a few things you can do before you start:

- You can read about [the top 5 mistakes that students make](top-5-mistakes)
- You can also have a [look at the FAQ](faq)
- You can learn [how to handle a complex and ambiguous project](complex-projects) 
- You can [review your project and look at the available documentation](project-wikis)
- You can also [use this internship as an opportunity to network](faq#i-know-that-the-internships-are-usually-100-offsite-but-what-if-i-want-to-go-into-the-office-sometimes)

If you have any questions or need further clarification regarding the internship program or the onboarding document, please feel free to reach out to me after you have looked through these documents. We are here to assist you and provide any necessary support.

We are looking forward to working with you and wish you a rewarding and successful internship experience.

Regards,

Rowland Mosbergen
