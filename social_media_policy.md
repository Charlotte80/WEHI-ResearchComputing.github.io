# Social Media Policy for students in the RCP Student Internship Program

This is the social media policy for open source contributors and students who are part of the RCP Student Internship Program.

1. When posting on social media, any images used must have the consent of the people in the image to be used in this way. It is best to ask permission before taking the image, but you can also ask after the image is taken. All people must consent for the image to be used as is.
2. When referring to your position at WEHI, if you are an open source contributor you can descibe yourself as a **Research Software Engineer contributor** or an **Open Source Contributor**. If you are a student intern you can refer to yourself as a **Research Software Engineer intern** or an **University Research Placement Studentr**. Any other position descriptions should be avoided.
3. All social media posts must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct).


Suggestions to improve your social media posts:
1. On LinkedIn, you can addd @wehi_research to your post to tag WEHI and @rowland_mosbergen to tag Rowland Mosbergen, who can boost your post if it follows the social media policy.
2. Feel free to use [the Research Computing Logo](/assets/rcp_logo.png).
