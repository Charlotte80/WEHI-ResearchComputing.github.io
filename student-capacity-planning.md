# Capacity Planning Storage and Compute Student Intern Project

WEHI is currently reviewing its storage and compute capacity and would like to create models to forecast capacity and create dashboards to demonstrate current usage and help make informed decisions.  

The Capacity Planning Data Scientist Intern and Capacity Planning Data Engineering Intern role will:   

- identify and integrate historical and current data from many different systems into an interactive dashboard for storage and compute,  
- develop and test models of future growth based on historical data and upcoming trends using appropriate statistical or machine learning models  
- create calculators and other tools to inform the decision making process 

There is also flexibility with this project to allow the student to inject their own ideas and introduce new features and functionality.  

Preferred skills: 
- Basic knowledge or willingness to learn, the combining and integrating of data from multiple sources like databases and APIs  
- Ability to learn and understand high-level concepts quickly  
- Ability to work independently and to report to a group and discuss theories and results  
- Good analytical skills  
- Previous experience with, or willingness to learn,  R or Python  

Benefits for students whilst undertaking the internship include:
- Each student will get hands on experience in working in a Big Data environment within a highly regarded medical research institute.   
- Practical experience in the maturing stages of a capacity planning project that will be used to help inform high-level decisions.  
- Gain understanding of how real-world information is assessed, developed and how priorities and requirements are established within a research environment.  
- Gain understanding of the importance of maintainable, scalable and extensible code and data.  
- Improving oral and written communication skills in a team environment.
