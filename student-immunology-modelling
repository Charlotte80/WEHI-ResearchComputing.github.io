# Immunology modelling 

Immunological responses to infection are complex and nuanced. Our ability to understand and manipulate these responses depends on sophisticated computer simulations of cellular processes. We have a built a framework that allows the easy construction of agent-based models to address question in immune cell biology.

This role involves enhancing the framework API to

- ensure it meets best software design principals so that it is easy to use and durable
- implements a testing framework
- wrap new numerical methods to express new classes of problems

There is also flexibility with this project to allow the student to inject their own ideas and introduce new features and functionality.

Skills and Pre-requisites:

- Knowledge of, or willingness to learn, the Julia programming language
- Knowledge of numerical methods or excellent software design and engineering skills


We aim to ensure that each student gets a great learning experience tailored to their ability, interest and experience.

- Each student will get hands on experience in working in an emerging research software environment within a highly regarded medical research institute.
- Practical experience in the early stages of a software project that could be used in an increasingly important domain supporting scientific research.
- Gain understanding of how real-world software is assessed, developed and how priorities and requirements are established within a research environment.
- Gain understanding of the importance of maintainable, scalable and extensible code.
- Improving oral and written communication skills in a team environment.
