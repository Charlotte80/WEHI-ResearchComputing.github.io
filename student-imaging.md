# Imaging Student Internship Project

## Introduction 

WEHI is currently developing its Research Data Management requirements and is evaluating products and tools for a hybrid Research Data Management ecosystem. The candidate will develop an understanding of data flow from WEHI microscopes such as a Lattice Light Sheet and determine how to automate the processing of microscopy files. The key output of the project is to further the current work around automated processing to the High Performance Compute. 

## Duties while on placement 

The Research Data Engineer Intern role will:  
- review existing semi-automated workflows that are processing of microscopy data, 
- further automate these workflows, including file conversions and transformations of the images, and 
- potentially apply custom imaging processing pipeline to the raw data. 


There is also flexibility with this project to allow the student to inject their own ideas and introduce new features and functionality. 

## Skills and Pre-requisites 

Skills and Pre-requisites: 
- Interest in cutting edge image processing 
- Basic knowledge of Linux command-line 
- Willingness and ability to learn and understand high-level concepts quickly 
- Ability to work independently and to report to a group and discuss theories and results 
- Good analytical skills 
- Previous experience with git would be useful but not necessary 


## Benefits for students 

Benefits for students whilst undertaking the internship include:
- Working in a High Performance Computing environment or adjacent environment. 
- Practical experience with potential exposure to Bash, Python, C++.  
- Gain understanding of how real-world software is assessed, developed and how priorities and requirements are established within a research environment.  
- Gain understanding of the importance of maintainable, scalable and extensible code.
