# Email Final Week

Hi All,

I would like to thank you all for being a part of this intake at WEHI, and for all your efforts. I hope that you were able to benefit from this internship.

To help us improve, [please provide anonymous feedback on the student internship](https://forms.office.com/r/XLTukQ9stB). 

We hope you will keep in touch with your teammates and supervisors. One way of doing this is to reach out via LinkedIn. I'm happy for you to [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowlandm-gaicd/) and via [the LinkedIn WEHI RCP Student Internship Alumni group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9384452/).

Another way to continue sharing your work from the internship. With the permission of your supervisor, consider uploading your presentation to a platform like Figshare or Zenodo. By doing so, you can make your findings and insights accessible to a wider audience.

When sharing your work on Figshare or a similar platform, remember to acknowledge your team mates as a co-author or contributor. Including them as an author ensures that credit is appropriately attributed to all individuals involved in the project.

I hope the experience of this internship helps you in your future career and gives you more understanding of what you want out of a work environment.

Regards,

Rowland Mosbergen
