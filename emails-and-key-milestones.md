# Key milestones and onboarding emails

We send you emails throughout your internship to ensure you are aware of what is coming up.

The key milestones are:
1. Week 1 - setup Workday, read documentation, schedule weekly meetings with your supervisors, and schedule two weekly meetings with your team members (and without your supervisor).
2. Week 2 - create a weekly template email to send to your supervisor one day before the weekly meeting, organise two weekly non-supervisor co-working sessions, setup technical diaries for each student, and continue to study for week 4 where you will be expected to answer high-level questions about the project.
3. Week 4 - draw up the high level problem on the virtual whiteboard to the satisfaction of your supervisors so that you can organise a meeting with stakeholders / subject matter experts (SMEs) in week 5.
4. Week 5 - meet up with stakeholders and subject matter experts.
5. Second last week - practice presentation and submission of one page summary report.
6. Last week - final presentation.
