# Students

The WEHI Research Computing Platform regularly provides student internship opportunities through the University of Melbourne Data Science and Software Engineering programs.

To understand more about the program, you can download and read the [RCP Student Internship Program Handbook.](/RDM-0220-RCP-Student-Internship-Handbook.pdf) 


## Recurring projects

Here are some of the recurring projects we are working on:

### Imaging - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project helps with the current work around automated processing to the High Performance Compute. For more details see [Imaging project](student-imaging).

### Immunology modelling - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project helps with enhancing the framework API for agent-based modelling in Immunology. For more details see [Immunology modelling project](student-immunology-modelling)

### Clinical Dashboards - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project helps to setup foundational infrastructure for adding visualisation dashboards for clinically-adjacent data. For more details see [Clinical Dashboards project.](student-clinical-dashboards)

### Genomics Quality Control - Software Engineering
This project helps to setup infrastructure to collate and display Quality Control (QC) information from Genomics workflows. For more details see [Genomics Quality Control project.](student-genomics-qc)

### BioNix - Software Engineering
This project helps with reproducibility in the field of Bioinformatics. For more details see [BioNix project](student-bionix).

### cryo-EM - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project looks to report and analyse Big Data cryo-EM workflows and use machine learning to inform future experimental design. For more details see [cryoEM project.](student-cryoem)

### LoxCodeR - Data Science of Software Engineering
This project looks to improve on LoxCodeR, a way of barcoding stem cells to follow how they differentiate to form other types of cells. For more details see [LoxCode project.](student-loxcoder)

### Haemosphere - Data Science or Software Engineering
This projects looks to improve on Haemosphere, which is like a web-based pocket dictionary for visualising and comparing genomic blood datasets. For more details see [Haemosphere project.](student-haemosphere)

### Capacity Planning (Storage and Compute) - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project looks to create models to forecast capacity and create dashboards to demonstrate current usage and help make informed decisions for storage and compute at WEHI. For more details see [Capacity Planning Storage and Compute project.](student-capacity-planning.md)

### Research Data Workflow Processing - Software Engineering
This project looks to define Research Data Management workflows and use them to benchmark High Performance Compute on WEHI infrastructure and beyond.
