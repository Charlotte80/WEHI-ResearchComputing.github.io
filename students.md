# Students

The WEHI Research Computing Platform regularly provides student internship opportunities through the University of Melbourne Data Science and Software Engineering programs.

Many of the projects work in the Data Analysis and [Research Software Engineering](https://rse-aunz.github.io/) space using High Performance Compute (HPC). We work across diverse projects such as imaging, cryo-EM, genomics, transcriptomics, clinical informatics, and capacity planning.

We mainly work with projects that use R and Shiny, Python, Julia, bash, while also making the most out of other technologies such as RStudio, Jupyter notebooks, PowerBI and other applications within the data analytics space.

Read through the whole of this webpage. How you apply is shown at the bottom of the page.

## Key Documents to review

- To understand more about the program, you can download and read the [RCP Student Internship Program Handbook](https://figshare.com/articles/presentation/Research_Computing_Platform_Student_Internship_Handbook/21259467), 
- You can also try to avoid [the top 5 mistakes that students make](top-5-mistakes).
- You can also have a look at the [FAQ online.](faq)
- We suggest that you write a 1 page cover letter introducing yourself. We also have [material on how to write a good cover letter and what to look for when you are writing a resume](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21057535.v2).

### Key Questions you should ask yourself

To help understand your interests and identify potential projects, there are four questions we ask you to answer in your cover letter: 


#### 1. Would you prefer to do data engineering, data analytics, full-stack web developer or software engineering?

Data engineering is focused on streamlining and cleaning data systematically.
Data analytics is focused on using cleaned data to visualise and use simple statistical methods (like a z-score).
Full-stack web develepor is about building dynamic websites.
Software engineering is focused on systematising analysis or tools that help us make decisions.

Sometimes our projects can involve all these aspects if you are interested enough!

#### 2. Can you tell me a story about learning a new concept quickly?

This might be starting a new job, or a new course and learning the language and the nuances of this new environment.

#### 3. Can you tell me a story about learning a new technical skill quickly?

This might be learning a new programming language or new technology in a short amount of time.

#### 4. Do you have any questions about the program?

Please let us know if you have any questions about the program that aren't answered in the [RCP Student Internship Program Handbook](/RDM-0220-RCP-Student-Internship-Handbook.pdf), the [FAQ online](faq), or the [RCP Student Internship Onboarding Checklist](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/RDM_0138_RCP_Student_Onboarding_Checklist/23280815).

## How to Apply

Due to the volume of students now applying to this internship, to be eligible you must [fill out the RCP Student Internship Enrollment form](https://redcap.wehi.edu.au/surveys/?s=AMYXK9FFHXR9LE9T). 

You can see the [intake dates here](intake_dates).

This is because we now need to streamline our applications and ensure no students are missed in the application process. To do this we need to move from a a manual process to this more automated process. We appreciate that there may be some confusion but any applicants will be redirected to this form as it takes precedence over any other application method.
