# Students

RCP regularly provides student internship opportunities through the University of Melbourne Data Science and Software Engineering programs.

We will be looking at Google Summer of Code and Outreachy in the near future.

We use our own version of this [student expectations document](https://www.practicaldiversity.org/2022/01/19/student-expectations-document/) as we want to ensure that our students get the best experience possible.

Here are some of the recurring projects we are working on:

### Capacity Planning (Storage) - Data Science
This project looks to create models to forecast capacity and create dashboards to demonstrate current usage and help make informed decisions for storage at WEHI.  

### Capacity Planning (Compute) - Data Science
This project looks to create models to forecast capacity and create dashboards to demonstrate current usage and help make informed decisions for compute at WEHI.

### Research Data Management Ecosystem - Software Engineering
This project looks to define Research Data Management requirements and evaluate products and tools for a hybrid Research Data Management ecosystem. 

### Research Data Workflow Processing - Software Engineering
This project looks to define Research Data Management workflows and use them to benchmark High Performance Compute on WEHI infrastructure and beyond.
