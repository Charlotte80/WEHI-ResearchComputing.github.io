# Students

The WEHI Research Computing Platform regularly provides student internship opportunities through the University of Melbourne Data Science and Software Engineering programs. These internships are 100% remote. Out of the 7 anonymous reviews that have been given by students as at 23rd of October 2023, our internships have been rated a 4.7 out of 5.

Many of the projects work in the Data Analysis and [Research Software Engineering](https://rse-aunz.github.io/) space using High Performance Compute (HPC). We work across diverse projects such as imaging, cryo-EM, genomics, transcriptomics, clinical informatics, and capacity planning.

We mainly work with projects that use R and Shiny, Python, Julia, bash, while also making the most out of other technologies such as RStudio, Jupyter notebooks, PowerBI and other applications within the data analytics space.

We prepare students for the real-world by teaching them [how understanding the domain problem and the users is more important than technical skills](complex-projects), showing them [how to become as independent as possible](faq#you-ask-us-to-be-as-independent-as-possible-how-can-we-do-that), and teaching them how to work productively in a remote environment.

We even tell students how to try to avoid [the top 5 mistakes that students make](top-5-mistakes).

Read through the whole of this webpage. How you apply is shown at the bottom of the page.
