# Students

The WEHI Research Computing Platform regularly provides student internship opportunities through the University of Melbourne Data Science and Software Engineering programs.

Many of the projects work in the Data Analysis and [Research Software Engineering](https://rse-aunz.github.io/) space using High Performance Compute (HPC). We work across diverse projects such as imaging, cryo-EM, genomics, transcriptomics, clinical informatics, and capacity planning.

We mainly work with projects that use R and Shiny, Python, Julia, bash, while also making the most out of other technologies such as RStudio, Jupyter notebooks, PowerBI and other applications within the data analytics space.

To understand more about the program, you can download and read the [RCP Student Internship Program Handbook.](/RDM-0220-RCP-Student-Internship-Handbook.pdf) 

## Key Questions you should ask yourself

To help understand your interests and identify potential projects, there are five questions we ask you to answer in your cover letter: 

### 1. Would you prefer to work in the research domain or the professional domain?

The projects in research are more complex than the professional ones, for those who love a challenge, are interested in biology, and are confident they can learn technical and conceptual ideas quickly.

The professional ones are more for those who want experience that might be aligned to business and are confident they can learn technical and conceptual ideas relatively quickly.

### 2. Would you prefer to do data engineering, data analysis, or software engineering?

Data engineering is focused on streamlining and cleaning data systematically.
Data analysis is focused on cleaning data and analysing it using statistical or machine learning algorithms.
Software engineering is focused on systematising analysis or tools that help us make decisions.

Sometimes our projects can involve all these aspects if you are interested enough!

### 3. Can you tell me a story about learning a new concept quickly?

This might be starting a new job, or a new course and learning the language and the nuances of this new environment.

### 4. Can you tell me a story about learning a new technical skill quickly?

This might be learning a new programming language or new technology in a short amount of time.

### 5. Do you have any questions about the program?

Please let us know if you have any questions about the program that aren't answered in the [RCP Student Internship Program Handbook.](/RDM-0220-RCP-Student-Internship-Handbook.pdf) 



## List of projects

Here are some of the recurring projects and new projects we are working on:

### Imaging - Research - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project helps with the current work around automated processing of images from microscopes to the High Performance Compute. For more details see [Imaging project](student-imaging).

### Immunology modelling - Research - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project helps with enhancing the framework API for agent-based modelling in Immunology. For more details see [Immunology modelling project](student-immunology-modelling)

### Clinical Dashboards - Research - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project helps to setup foundational infrastructure for adding visualisation dashboards for clinically-adjacent data. For more details see [Clinical Dashboards project.](student-clinical-dashboards)

### Genomics Quality Control - Research - Software Engineering
This project helps to setup infrastructure to collate and display Quality Control (QC) information from Genomics workflows. For more details see [Genomics Quality Control project.](student-genomics-qc)

### BioNix - Research - Software Engineering
This project helps with reproducibility in the field of Bioinformatics. For more details see [BioNix project](student-bionix).

### cryo-EM - Research - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project looks to report and analyse Big Data cryo-EM workflows and use machine learning to inform future experimental design. For more details see [cryoEM project.](student-cryoem)

### LoxCodeR - Research - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project looks to improve on LoxCodeR, a way of barcoding stem cells to follow how they differentiate to form other types of cells. For more details see [LoxCode project.](student-loxcoder)

### Haemosphere - Research - Data Science or Software Engineering
This projects looks to improve on Haemosphere, which is like a web-based pocket dictionary for visualising and comparing genomic blood datasets. For more details see [Haemosphere project.](student-haemosphere)

### Capacity Planning (Storage and Compute) - Professional - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project looks to create models to forecast capacity and create dashboards to demonstrate current usage and help make informed decisions for storage and compute at WEHI. For more details see [Capacity Planning Storage and Compute project.](student-capacity-planning.md)

### Research Data Workflow Processing - Research -  Software Engineering
This project looks to define Research Data Management workflows and use them to benchmark High Performance Compute on WEHI infrastructure and beyond.
