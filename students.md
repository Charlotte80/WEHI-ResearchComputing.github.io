# Students

RCP regularly provides student internship opportunities through the University of Melbourne Data Science and Software Engineering programs.

We will be looking at Google Summer of Code and Outreachy in the near future.

To understand more about the program, you can download and read the [RCP Student Internship Program Handbook.](/RDM-0220-RCP-Student-Internship-Handbook.pdf) 

## Stories from students and hosts

Here is a story from one of our newsletters in November 2021:

Recently, WEHI has started an initiative of student internships from the Masters of Data Science and Masters of Engineering courses at the University of Melbourne. We see this as an opportunity to reach out to the new generation of software engineers and data scientists and give them a hands-on experience in medical research by collaborating with researchers. 

The Naik lab collaboration had multiple students working on extending their LoxCodeR Shiny app. Our collaboration with the Hilton lab included a student working on migrating Haemosphere to Python 3 and improving the underlying software infrastructure. We also initiated an internal project for data storage capacity planning. 

One of the challenges that the students faced was the complexity of the biology. But as the internships continued, they found ways to solve this. 

“Students were intially worried as the biology was too complex and overwhelming. But they found that while they have to understand the high-level biology, once they combine that with looking at the code and the data, everything tends to make more sense and they can be more productive.” says Rowland Mosbergen, a member of the Research Computing Platform. “It is more important that students have an openness to learn, and critical thinking to put everything together, than it is to have a deep background in biology”. 

It is safe to say that the results have been appreciated both by students and collaborators. 

Dr Carolyn de Graaf from the Hilton lab worked with Nirmala Dhanawada (Masters of Information technology) on the Haemosphere project and had this to say about the program. 

"I am so pleased that you thought of Haemosphere for this program. It is hard to get the resources to maintain software after it has been published, but I will sleep better at night knowing that the code has been updated and is more stable. "

Kush Garg from the Master of Data Science worked on the data storage capacity planning project and had this to say about his time at WEHI. 

"I would like to express my gratitude for all the support and guidance throughout this internship. 

Also, it has been a great time working at WEHI. I learnt a lot in terms of real-world experience and starting a new project. The discussions and presentations helped me to improve my communication skills, develop curiosity around the problem statement and solutions." 

We thank all our students for the effort they have done and look forward to meeting future students. 

## Recurring projects

Here are some of the recurring projects we are working on:



### Imaging - Software Engineering and Data Science
This project helps with the current work around automated processing to the High Performance Compute. For more details see [Imaging project](student-imaging).

### Immunology modelling - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project helps with enhancing the framework API for agent-based modelling in Immunology. For more details see [Immunology modelling project](student-immunology-modelling)

### Clinical Dashboards - Data Science or Software Engineering
This project helps to setup foundational infrastructure for adding visualisation dashboards for clinically-adjacent data. For more details see [Clinical Dashboards project.](student-clinical-dashboards)

### BioNix - Software Engineering
This project helps with reproducibility in the field of Bioinformatics. For more details see [BioNix project](student-bionix).

### Haemosphere - Software Engineering
This projects looks to improve on Haemosphere, which is like a web-based pocket dictionary for visualising and comparing genomic blood datasets.

### LoxCodeR - Data Science
This project looks to improve on LoxCodeR, a way of barcoding stem cells to follow how they differentiate to form other types of cells.

### cryo-EM - Software Engineering
This project looks to report and analyse Big Data cryo-EM workflows and use machine learning to inform future experimental design. For more details see [cryoEM project.](student-cryoem)

### Capacity Planning (Storage) - Data Science
This project looks to create models to forecast capacity and create dashboards to demonstrate current usage and help make informed decisions for storage at WEHI.  

### Capacity Planning (Compute) - Data Science
This project looks to create models to forecast capacity and create dashboards to demonstrate current usage and help make informed decisions for compute at WEHI.

### Research Data Workflow Processing - Software Engineering
This project looks to define Research Data Management workflows and use them to benchmark High Performance Compute on WEHI infrastructure and beyond.


## Other projects

There are more projects on the [Google Summer of Code](gsoc) page that could be brought into our standard student internship program.
