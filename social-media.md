This is for students and the program co-ordinator to make it easy to share social media posts about the WEHI RCP Research Software Engineer Student Internship Program.

## End of week 3 - preparing for whiteboard

Week 3 is ending for the Research Software Engineering students and they are all getting ready for the week 4 whiteboard presentation.

In week 4, as a team, the students have to draw up the high level problem on the virtual whiteboard to the satisfaction of their supervisors.

This includes explaining the why's of the high level problem, the limitations of any potential architecture and algorithms, the potential issue and assumptions that have to be tested, and how they will approach the rest of the internship.

This is so that when they talk to stakeholders / subject matter experts (SMEs) in week 5 they can hold a more sophisticated conversation.

This can lead to the students being more independent from their supervisors.

It also allows then to test their continuous improvement skills in a safe space: critical thinking, tolerance for ambiguity, tolerance for complexity, adaptability, learnability and bring collaborative.

## End of week 4 - whiteboard outcomes

This week, students have been participating in whiteboard presentations, each sharing their understanding of the project with enthusiasm.


In a safe and supportive learning environment, the process involved the students putting together the diagram from scratch or from pre-created images. Then the supervisors asked students questions while also providing assistance when needed, fostering a collaborative approach to learning. Most of the questions were around the whys more than the whats - eg. "Why did you choose this?".

We do this to gauge the students' understanding of the topic being presented and are designed to encourage critical thinking and reflection, prompting students to articulate their thoughts and ideas.

On reflection, the most interesting ....

## Week 10 final presentations around the corner

It is week 10 and we've got our practice presentations coming up soon on the second last week, along with that one page summary report we've been working on. It's all part of getting ready for those final presentations.

Let's use this opportunity to share what we've learned, what we've done, what we would have done differently for next time and what the future could hold!

And pro-tip - practice with your sister projects and share an early draft with your supervisor so that both of them can give you feedback early!

## Second last week - practice presentations and handing in summary report

We are getting so close to the end of the internship! This week we have students practicing their final presentations and handing in their one page summary report.

The final presentation is used to give the students practice in presenting their work and also reflect on what they learned and what they would do differnently if they were faced with a similar project in the future.

The one page summary report summarises the high-level domain, architecture/algorithm, and technical work the students did over the course of the intake. This makes it easier to share the whole range of work that was done across all projects.
