## End of week 3 - preparing for whiteboard

Week 3 is ending for the Research Software Engineering students and they are all getting ready for the week 4 whiteboard presentation.

In week 4, as a team, the students have to draw up the high level problem on the virtual whiteboard to the satisfaction of their supervisors.

This includes explaining the why's of the high level problem, the limitations of any potential architecture and algorithms, the potential issue and assumptions that have to be tested, and how they will approach the rest of the internship.

This is so that when they talk to stakeholders / subject matter experts (SMEs) in week 5 they can hold a more sophisticated conversation.

This can lead to the students being more independent from their supervisors.

It also allows then to test their continuous improvement skills in a safe space: critical thinking, tolerance for ambiguity, tolerance for complexity, adaptability, learnability and bring collaborative.

## End of week 4 - whiteboard outcomes

This week, students have been participating in whiteboard presentations, each sharing their understanding of the project with enthusiasm.


In a safe and supportive learning environment, the process involved the students putting together the diagram from scratch or from pre-created images. Then the supervisors asked students questions while also providing assistance when needed, fostering a collaborative approach to learning. Most of the questions were around the whys more than the whats - eg. "Why did you choose this?".

We do this to gauge the students' understanding of the topic being presented and are designed to encourage critical thinking and reflection, prompting students to articulate their thoughts and ideas.

On reflection, the most interesting ....
