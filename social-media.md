## End of week 3 - preparing for whiteboard

Week 3 is ending for the Research Software Engineering students and they are all getting ready for the week 4 whiteboard presentation.

In week 4, as a team, the students have to draw up the high level problem on the virtual whiteboard to the satisfaction of their supervisors.

This includes explaining the why's of the high level problem, the limitations of any potential architecture and algorithms, the potential issue and assumptions that have to be tested, and how they will approach the rest of the internship.

This is so that when they talk to stakeholders / subject matter experts (SMEs) in week 5 they can hold a more sophisticated conversation.

This can lead to the students being more independent from their supervisors.

It also allows then to test their continuous improvement skills in a safe space: critical thinking, tolerance for ambiguity, tolerance for complexity, adaptability, learnability and bring collaborative.
