# Research Data Architect (Data Lakehouse / Data Commons) 

## Introduction

As part of our ongoing efforts to evaluate and implement innovative data management strategies, we are offering an internship opportunity to work on a proof-of-concept project for a data lakehouse / data commons. We are seeking a motivated and detail-oriented intern to join our team and contribute to the development of a proof-of-concept data infrastructure. 

## Duties while on placement

As a Data Architecture Intern, you will play a crucial role in supporting the design and implementation of a proof-of-concept data lakehouse / data commons. This internship will provide you with valuable hands-on experience in data architecture. You will assist in building a scalable data management infrastructure and gain exposure to various aspects of data integration, modeling, and governance.

The Research Data Architect Intern role will: 
- Assist in designing and implementing data models for the proof-of-concept data lakehouse / data commons. 
- Work with the team to define conceptual and logical data models that align with project objectives. 
- Support the implementation of data ingestion pipelines for the proof-of-concept.
- Contribute to the development of data governance practices and policies for the proof-of-concept project. 
- Collaborate with the team to plan and possibly build the data management infrastructure for the proof-of-concept data lakehouse / data commons.
- Assist in documenting the data architecture, design decisions, and implementation processes. Contribute to creating technical documentation and user guides for future reference. 
- Stay updated on emerging data management technologies and industry trends. 
- Explore and experiment with new tools, frameworks, and platforms that can enhance the data lakehouse / data commons implementation. 

## Skills and Pre-requisites

To excel in this internship project, the ideal candidate should have a willingness to research data lakehouses and data commons, an ability to learn quickly, an enthusiasm for data architecture, and a willingness to share and communicate information. 



## Benefits for students 

The benefits for students whilst undertaking the internship include:

- The student will learn the basic awareness and knowledge of data architecture.
- Basic awareness and knowledge of the ecosystem that needs to surround data architecture. 
- Ability to communicate and share complex information to key stakeholders in their language. 
- Experience with researchers and ability to navigate a research environment.
