# Email - Week 3

Hi All,

This is your email to start week 3 of your internship. You are probably getting your head around the concepts and perhaps still feeling a little bit anxious too. That’s OK. Please remember that this is a “best-effort” internship for most of you and we are trying to see how good you really are in a safe environment. Remember, you can always ask your supervisor or me for help.


## Goals for the week

1. Read about the high-level project itself, and go back and watch the recording from week 2.
2. Send your weekly email update to your supervisors one day before the weekly meeting. This should be the standard across all the future weekly project meetings. Usually, students who do not send regular email updates usually do not do well and do not receive good references by their supervisors.
3. Practice with your team mates on how you would draw up the high-level problem on the whiteboard. This is because you will need to do this in front of your supervisors. If you pass, you will get permission to reach out to stakeholders and SMEs to setup a time to meet them in week 5.
4. You should be meeting with your other team mates at least twice a week for co-working sessions.

You can see the full list in [the key milestones and onboarding emails page](emails-and-key-milestones).
