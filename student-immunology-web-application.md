# Immunology Web Application

When challenged with an infection, or cancer, our immune system needs to rapidly produce new immune cells to fight the attack. Once the pathogen is cleared, these cells need to die away. Immune cells have therefore evolved highly tuned strategies to determine when they should divide, how long they need to divide for and when they need to die. Our lab has developed a sophisticated mathematical model, called Cyton, that can extract the parameters underlying these fate decisions from experimental data.  

The Cyton model is internationally recognised as a critical component in analysis and design of experiments of quantitative immune responses. To make Cyton accessible to the scientific community, we would like to provide a web application that researchers can access with their browsers from anywhere in the world. When complete, the project will be published as open source. 

The Research Software Engineer Intern role will:  

- Will work with researchers to understand requirements 
- Be responsible for designing the application 
- Implement and test the application 
- Provide documentation 

## Skills and pre-requisites

The skills required for this project are expertise in python and experience developing web applications. Initial assessment of applicants will be based on a demonstration application and code repository for which the applicant has made a significant contribution. 

## What are the key skills you anticipate students will develop whilst undertaking the internship? 

- Intermediate to advanced skills in python. 
- Intermediate to advanced knowledge of building web applications. 
- Experience with agile development methodologies. 

## Other information 

The web application is a reimplementation of this Python application https://github.com/evan-wehi/cyton-solver
